# TimeStretch: Expand Your Day

TimeStretch is a productivity app that allows you to stretch your day by adjusting the number of hours.

Currently, a day consists of 24 hours, but with TimeStretch, you can select a range of 16 to 48 hours. This means each hour will have more or fewer minutes, and each minute will have 60 seconds.

You can also choose to enable notifications, which will provide push messages, sound, and vibration.

TimeStretch empowers you to increase your productivity by expanding the hours available in a day.
